# MindsEye Android LAW-T Runtime

The Android LAW-T Runtime is the mobile node for the MindsEye OS.

It provides:

- **LAW-T** (Law of Time) time-labeling on all device events  
- **LAW-N** (Law of Network) metadata for runtime decisions  
- **TLDI** — Time-Labeled Device Interface  
- **Duo Bluetooth**: multi-device routing + sharded sharing  
- **Device fingerprinting** via binary pattern extraction  
- **Local data splitting & secure routing**

This repo is Part 3 of the MindsEye OS (Agent & Device Layer).
